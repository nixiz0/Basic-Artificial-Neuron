## Basic Implementation of Artificial Neurons

Construction of artificial neural network structure : 

- Build of an Artificial Neuron 
- Build of an MLP (Multi-layers Perceptron)

### Interface & Code 
You have at your disposal a **tkinter interface** which allows you to test different values ​​of *learning rate* and *iterations* for the **artificial neuron** as well as for the **multilayer perceptron** and you can enter *different layer depths* for the MLP with the number of neurons per layer that you want.

### Dataset
Here we use a **XOR Dataset** for the training, it's a basic dataset but you can modify the **X** and **y** for put your *own data* but don't forget to **be careful to respect the dimensions** so asn't to have a problem !
